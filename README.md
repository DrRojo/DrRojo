## About Me

I am a seasoned professional with over nine years of experience in personnel management and leadership, honed during my tenure in the Army. My military career includes significant achievements such as maintaining accountability for over $15 million in high-value equipment and leading a four-man team with a perfect success rate.

Transitioning to the civilian workforce, I worked at Lewis Marketing Inc. in roles ranging from Warehouse Operations Manager to Commercial Quotations, specializing in quoting commercial projects and enhancing operational efficiency.

Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, focusing on Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, and Gaming. I also hold a Bachelor of Science in Technical Management from DeVry University.
